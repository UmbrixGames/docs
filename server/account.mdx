description: "Understanding your Umbrix UID and account across UmbrixGames platforms"
---

Your UmbrixGames account connects you across all our platforms and games, identified by a unique Umbrix UID.

## Umbrix UID

Your **Umbrix UID** (User Identifier) is your unique identifier across the entire UmbrixGames ecosystem.

### What is the Umbrix UID?

The Umbrix UID is a **7-digit number** that identifies you across all UmbrixGames platforms:

- **Tenebris** - Skyblock RPG server
- **Obsidium** - *(Coming soon)*
- **Project Dark Tide** - *(Coming soon)*

<Note>
  Your Umbrix UID remains the same across all UmbrixGames games and platforms. One account, one identity.
</Note>

### UID Format

All Umbrix UIDs follow this format:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Length** | 7 digits |
| **Prefix** | Always starts with `40` |
| **Range** | 4000001 - 4099999 |

**Examples:**
- First user: `4000001`
- Second user: `4000002`
- Example UID: `4012345`

### Finding Your UID

You can find your Umbrix UID in several ways:

```bash
/uid           # Display your Umbrix UID
/profile       # View your full profile including UID
```

Your UID also appears:
- In your profile menu
