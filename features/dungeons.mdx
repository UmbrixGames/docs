In Tenebris Skyblock, you'll find one of the most complex and intricate Dungeon Systems available in the Minecraft server space.

## What is a Dungeon?

A dungeon is an **instance-based, private area** where players get to kill mobs, loot chests, and fight bosses to earn rewards. Raiding dungeons is essential for progressing through the game and rewards some of the most useful and powerful pieces of gear.

## How Dungeons Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spawn Room">
    When a player or party starts a dungeon, everyone spawns into a spawn room
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather at the Entrance">
    Once all players gather around the entrance door, it opens up and the dungeon begins
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Rooms">
    Clear each room by killing all mobs—the door to the next room opens when no mobs remain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loot Chests">
    Scattered throughout each room are loot chests containing various rewards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Defeat the Mini-Boss">
    In the final room, face a mini-boss before advancing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Boss Chamber">
    Get teleported to the Boss Chamber for the ultimate challenge
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Rewards">
    After defeating the boss, enter the Rewards Chamber
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dungeon Phases

### Room Clearing

Each dungeon consists of multiple rooms that must be cleared in sequence:

- **Kill all mobs** in the current room
- **Loot chests** scattered around the room for bonus rewards
- **Proceed through the door** once the room is clear

<Tip>
  Take your time to find all loot chests before moving on—they contain valuable materials!
</Tip>

### Mini-Boss

The last room before the Boss Chamber features a **mini-boss**:

- Stronger than regular mobs
- Has unique attack patterns
- Defeating it teleports your party to the Boss Chamber

### Boss Chamber

The Boss Chamber is the final obstacle of the dungeon:

<Warning>
  Boss fights are challenging! Make sure your party is prepared with potions and proper gear.
</Warning>

- Features one very powerful boss
- Complex mechanics and attack phases
- Once defeated, the dungeon is completed
- All players are teleported to the **Rewards Chamber**

## Rewards Chamber

After completing a dungeon, you enter the Rewards Chamber featuring **3 reward chests**:

| Chest | Key Required | Loot Quality |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 💎 **Diamond Chest** | Diamond Key | Good rewards |
| 💚 **Emerald Chest** | Emerald Key | Better rewards |
| ⭐ **Star Chest** | Star Key | Best rewards |

### How Reward Chests Work

- Each chest requires its **respective key** to open
- Each player can open **up to all three chests** (if they have the keys)
- Loot quality varies based on the chest tier
- Keys are earned from dungeon runs, quests, and special events

<Note>
  Save your Star Keys for the most challenging dungeons—they have the best drop tables!
</Note>

## Dungeon Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

## Party Dungeons

For the most challenging dungeons, team up with other players:

```bash
/party create           # Create a new party
/party invite <player>  # Invite a player
/party accept           # Accept party invitation
/party leave            # Leave current party
```

### Party Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Best Class |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Tank** | Hold enemy attention, absorb damage | Warrior |
| **Healer** | Keep party alive | Mage |
| **DPS** | Eliminate enemies quickly | Archer, Warrior |

<Tip>
  Communication is key! Use Discord voice chat for harder dungeons.
