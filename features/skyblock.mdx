Tenebris combines classic Skyblock gameplay with enhanced progression systems that tie into the RPG elements of the server.

## Your Island

Your island is your home base in Tenebris. Unlike traditional Skyblock, your island connects to the greater world and serves as your hub for crafting, storage, and preparation.

### Island Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/island create` | Create your personal island |
| `/island home` | Teleport to your island |
| `/island settings` | Configure island permissions |
| `/island invite <player>` | Invite a player to your island |
| `/island kick <player>` | Remove a player from your island |
| `/island level` | Check your island's level |

## Progression System

Your island progresses through levels based on the blocks and structures you build.

### Island Levels

- **Tier 4:** Diamond, Emerald

## Island Upgrades

Invest resources to unlock permanent island upgrades:

| Upgrade | Effect |

| **Island Size** | Expand your building area |
| **Generator Tier** | Better ore generation |
| **Mob Spawner Slots** | Place more spawners |
