The Forging System is Tenebris' crafting system, allowing you to create powerful custom equipment with unique models and textures.

## Overview

Forging is more than simple crafting—it's a progression system where you:

1. **Gather materials** from dungeons, islands, and quests
2. **Craft base equipment** at the Forge
3. **Upgrade items** to increase their power
4. **Apply enchantments** for unique effects

## Accessing the Forge

Visit the Forge in the main hub or use the command:

```bash
/forge          # Open the forging menu
/forge recipes  # View available recipes
```

2. Add required upgrade materials
3. Confirm the upgrade

### Success Rates

| Uncommon → Rare | 80% | 25 Essence + 5 Crystals |
| Rare → Epic | 50% | 50 Essence + 15 Crystals |

<Note>
  Failed upgrades don't destroy the item, but you lose the materials. Use Protection Scrolls to increase success rates!
</Note>

## Custom Textures

Epic and Legendary equipment features **custom textures** that display unique models:

- **Epic items:** Custom 2D textures
- **Legendary items:** Full 3D custom models with particle effects

<Tip>
  Requires a compatible resource pack. The pack downloads automatically when you join the server!
