Factions are the class system of Tenebris, providing specialized stat boosts tailored to specific playstyles. Unlike traditional RPGs, joining a faction is completely optional, but highly recommended for those wanting to maximize their potential.

## What Are Factions?

Think of factions as **renamed classes**. Instead of locking you into a rigid role, Factions provide an array of **stat boosts** suited towards a specific combat style:

- **Melee** (Warrior playstyle)
- **Ranged** (Archer playstyle)
- **Magic** (Mage playstyle)

<Note>
  **Factions are not required.** You can play Tenebris without ever joining a faction, though you will miss out on significant power bonuses.
</Note>
